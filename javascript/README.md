### Instructions:

Write a JavaScript function that takes a number for an argument and returns a string of random characters
items you will need:
* A function that takes a parameter
* A variable to hold your result in
* A variable of all possible upper and lower case letters and numbers (provided)
* A for loop to loop through and get a random character from the string of letters and numbers
* A return statement of the updated variable that holds our result
* A console log that calls the function and provides a number parameter

Bonus: Do the same as above but instead of updating a variable, push that data into a new array and join (join is a js method) the array to create the returned string.
